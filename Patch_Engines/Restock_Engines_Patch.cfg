	@description = F-1B, the next step in the F-1  engines lineage, is a modernised  image of the famous V5 engine. The F-1B engine, comparing to his predecessor, has 5000 fewer parts in the combustion chamber, lower hence costs, optimised turbopump and turbine exhaust duct. Selective laser melting, which is also used, allows simplify its manufacturing and usage. In the other words, the F-1B engine is a new modern classic for the upcoming human space returnal.
