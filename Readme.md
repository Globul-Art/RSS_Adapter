# Adapter for Real Solar System

### DESCRIPTION

The mod is designed for easy and comfortable playing with RSS. It changes the engines and fuel so you can build rockets similar to those in the stock system (designs, number of tanks and stages).
The parameters were selected in such a way that game replicas of known carrier rockets from the real world could perform approximately the same tasks in terms of mass payload.
The mod does not change the tanks, so you can install any additional tanks and they will work correctly.

All standard engines and engines from DLC are assigned names and characteristics of their prototypes from the real world.

### INSTRUCTIONS

There are the dependancies:
- **[Module Manager](https://ksp.sarbian.com/jenkins/job/ModuleManager/)** -- which is always necessary.
- **[Custom Barn Kit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/109027-18-custom-barn-kit-1120-19-october-2019-parachute-included/)** -- for the launchpad improvements (your LVs will be much heavier now)
- **[Cryo Tanks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/195042-112x-cryotanks-liquid-hydrogen-storage-and-management-oct-25-2021/)** -- real engines use real fuels (hydrolox and metalox) hydrazine is added by this addon. :)
- **Do not forget to install Cryo Tank's dependancies.**

***

And I strongly recommend you to install [RealEnginesPack 2.01](https://spacedock.info/mod/1212/RealEngines#changelog) -- 'cause you'll need more real engines for the real crafts!  
(I even made the Waterfall based effect for them!) ;)  
"Tantares" is a must have addon, FMPOV -- install my addon and their engines'll become the real ones too.  
  
You can instal BDB (Bluedog), but I don't know how will they work together.
