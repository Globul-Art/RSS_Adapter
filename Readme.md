# Adapter for Real Solar System

### DESCRIPTION

This addon is intender of an easy and cozy game in the RSS mod. You'll fly, leave and orbit Kerbin in the same crafts, wich you did in the stock Kerbol system.

This addon's adapting your gameplay on the base game's level -- fuels and propellants. And, by making this, there is no matter, what mods you will add later -- this addon doesn't change tanks and their characteristics, all you "new' ones will contain the right fuel by default.  
Parameters have been, made and changed based on this simple fact, that KSP's replicas of the most famous launch vehicles must be, look and deliver to orbit (and beyond) the same mass of payload, which originals do.

### INSTRUCTIONS

There are the dependancies:

- [Custom Barn Kit](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/109027-18-custom-barn-kit-1120-19-october-2019-parachute-included/) -- for the launchpad improvements (your LVs will be much heavier now)
] -- for the launchpad improvements (your LVs will be much heavier now)
- [Cryo Tanks](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/195042-112x-cryotanks-liquid-hydrogen-storage-and-management-oct-25-2021/) -- real engines use real fuels (hydrolox and metalox) hydrazine is added by this addon. :)
- Do not forget to install Cryo Tank's dependancy.


And I strongly recommend you to install "RealEnginesPack 2.01" -- 'cause you'll need more real engines for the real crafts! (I even made the Waterfall based effect for them!) ;)  
"Tantares" is a must have addon, FMPOV -- install my addon and their engines'll become the real ones too (yeah, not all of them... but only for now)
You can instal BDB (Bluedog), but I don't know how will they work together

### NOTES

My addon is not pretending to give your LVs THE REAL chracteristics. Your crafts might look like the real, and might work quite plausible, but they won't be THE SAME AS THE REAL ONES.
But, after all, you craft will make it to the KEO (or LEO, as you prefer) in RSS addon with my addon.  
Engines' characteristics are based on the real ones, they named real, they have reallictic thrust and isp, but they're not apadted for the KSP.


Have fun!
